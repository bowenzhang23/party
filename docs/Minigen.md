# Minigen

## Overview

Write a minimal parton-level event generator in Rust.

It can do ee -> y -> mumu at a lepton collider and qqbar -> Z/y -> mumu and a hadron collider.

Based on the reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4677.pdf

> This is not a general purpose event generator

## Devlog

[todo] Support multi-D integration
[todo] ee -> y -> mumu
[todo] parton distribution function
[todo] qqbar -> Z/y -> mumu
